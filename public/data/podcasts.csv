What is a mentally healthy response to death, destruction, and moral horror? In When Johnny and Jane Come Marching Home, Caplan argues that the standard treatment of therapy and drugs is often actually harmful. It adds to veterans' burdens by making them believe wrongly that they should have ""gotten over it""; it isolates them behind the closed doors of the therapist's office; and it makes them rely on often harmful drugs. The numbers of traumatized veterans from past and present wars who continue to suffer demonstrate the ineffectiveness of this approach.  Sending anguished veterans off to talk to therapists, writes Caplan, conveys the message that the rest of ","https://static.libsyn.com/p/assets/f/f/e/a/ffeaa0a2d8b9be44/Scribl_When_Johnny_and_Jane_Come_Marching_Home_Square.jpg",Yes,0,2025-12-06T03:30:00.445+00:00

When Adam reported these predators, many of them were intercollegiate athletes. A majority of them played for the Air Force Academy football team. The Superintendent at the time, Lt Gen Michael C. Gould, ensured that most of these criminal investigations were dismissed. As a result, those that reported sexual assault had their promising careers and livelihoods taken from them.

I couldn’t understand why this was happening and why these things were allowed. Our voices were squandered due to coercion, the lack of someone willing to listen and believe us, or just the plain feeling of hopelessness. Throughout my journey in the military, it often felt like I was a second-class citizen, as a woman, and especially as a black woman.

South Africa’s 23 year border war has been almost forgotten as the Cold War ebbed away and bygones were swept under the political carpet. South African politicians, particularly the ANC and the National Party, decided during negotiations to end years of conflict that the Truth and Reconciliation commission would focus on the internal struggle inside South Africa.   For most conscripts in the South African Defence Force, the SADF, they completed matric and then were drafted into the military.

Last year statistics show that 120,000 people lost their lives in more than 30 wars in virtually every region of our world. Finding just and lasting solutions to those crises requires huge skill and perseverance. But it also requires the public globally and their politicians to more fully understand the nature and histories of those conflicts.

The point man on a team is typically responsible for choosing the most effective path to get to the teams objective and then leading the way to get the entire team there safely.  As the forward most person the point typically assumes a lot of the dangers which creates a safer journey for the rest of the team.  When breaking through thick brush the point spends a lot of time knocking down brush and bushes which in turn gives an easier path for the team members to follow their lead.This is my hope for this podcast.  That myself and our guests can act as a point person for you in your next steps in life.  Which would include providing a path for you to follow, reducing risks for you, and making the journey the most effective that it possibly can be.
